〘 Apparently, I am ***A*** senior technician in IT 〙

〘 I was a professor ***I***n tertiary institutions and at a public university 〙
 ##
Apparently, my technical focus is on:

- Possibly **systems analysis**🟢
- Perhaps some **automation**🟡
- Sometimes **optimization and mathematical logic**🟠
 ##
- 💻​ **private github projects?** Some of them are in the final stages, others have many errors, and perhaps none of them will ever see the light.
- 💬 **Ask me about** ~~Carl Sagan~~... *topics related to this digital world.* ​
 
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** It seems that many years ago **Linus Torvalds** indirectly predicted with a single sentence that AI would
arrive to do much (or every) of our work. He said: *"Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work done"*
