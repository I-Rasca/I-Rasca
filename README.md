**I-Rasca/I-Rasca** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->
- 🔭 **I’m currently working on** independent projects related to systems analysis and code documentation.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning** everything, but one thing at a time.
- 💻​ **private github projects:** Some of them are in the final stages, others have many errors, and perhaps none of them will ever see the light.
<!-- - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... -->
- 💬 **Ask me about** ~~Carl Sagan~~... *topics related to this digital world.* ​

- ⚡ **Fun fact:** It seems that many years ago **Linus Torvalds** indirectly predicted with a single sentence that AI would
arrive to do much (or every) of our work. He said: *"Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work done"*
